But it is only one side of the coin. It can do more than expected. Therefore I am developing bookdownplus. bookdownplus is an extension of bookdown. It helps you write academic journal articles, guitar books, chemical equations, mails, calendars, and diaries. 1 Materials and Methods Although this section might not be the latest version, the general idea wont change. Please see R bookdownplus Textbook to keep up with the update. 1.1 Preparation Before starting, you have to install R, RStudio, bookdown package, and other software and packages (i.e. Pandoc, LaTeX, rmarkdown, rticle, knitr, etc.) which bookdown depends on. See the official manual of bookdown for details. Additionally, if you want to produce a poster, phython must be installed before using, and the path of phython might have to be added to the environmental variables for Windows users. 1.2 Installation install.package(&quot;bookdownplus&quot;) # or devtools:: install_github(&quot;pzhaonet/bookdownplus&quot;) 1.3 Generate demo files Run the following codes, and you will get some files (e.g. index.Rmd, body.Rmd, bookdownplus.Rproj) and folders in your working directory. getwd() # this is your working directory. run setwd() to change it. bookdownplus::bookdownplus() 1.4 Build a demo book Now open bookdownplus.Rproj with RStudio, and press ctrl+shift+b to compile it. Your will get a book file named *.pdf in _book/folder. 1.5 Write your own Write your own text in index.Rmd and body.Rmd, and build your own lovely book. 1.6 More outputs By default, the book is in a pdf file. From bookdownplus 1.0.3, users can get more output formats, including word, html and epub. Run: bookdownplus:: bookdownplus(template = &#39;article&#39;, more_output = c(&#39;html&#39;, &#39;word&#39;, &#39;epub&#39;)) 1.7 Recommendations I have been developing some other packages, which bring more features into bookdown, such as: mindr (Zhao 2017b), which can extract the outline of your book and turn it into a mind map, and pinyin (Zhao 2017c), which can automatically generate {#ID} of the chapter headers even if there are Chinese characters in them. Both of them have been released on CRAN and can be installed via: install.packages(&#39;mindr&#39;) install.packages(&#39;pinyin&#39;) Enjoy your bookdowning! 1.8 Models Eq. (1.1) is an equation. \\[\\begin{equation} E = mc^2 \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] It can be written as \\(E = mc^2\\).
